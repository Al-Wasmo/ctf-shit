## Steps
- i kept doing random stuff untill i wrote the parser and realized the input is the vars 
- i sorted the events using the formula `bar + beat` to get a `timestamp`
- i wrote a parser to convert the sorted event like format to some a readable psudo_code check `event_to_psudo_code.py` and output `psudo_code`
- i edited the `task.rdlevel` to test some stuff and get a better idea how the program works
    - i removed some checks
    - i only checked for part of the flag (`ww` and `f{`), and i got `correct flag`
- from there i used the editor to guess how the program of the game works
- i used python and some fixed values i know to guess the program
- check `flag.py` for the rest of the solve


## More Stuff 
- the editor only shows last 3 values updated, it helped me so much when guessing but i really would loved if it showed all the values, to fix that i could've just added some visual text in the editor




## Notes
- i used the editor to solve this chall, but its too huge to put in github, so here is a [link to it](https://rd-editor-docs.github.io/intro/)
